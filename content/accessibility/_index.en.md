# Accessibility declaration 
This declaration on accessibility applies to the chat application Matrix/Element of the Technische Universität Dresden published at https://matrix.tu-dresden.de.

As a public body within the meaning of the Barrier-free Web Sites Act (BfWebG), the Dresden University of Technology makes every effort to make its Web sites and mobile applications accessible without barriers in accordance with the provisions of the Barrier-free Web Sites Act (BfWebG) in conjunction with the Barrier-free Information Technology Ordinance (BITV 2.0).

## Creation of this declaration of accessibility
This declaration was prepared on 05.09.2020 and last updated on 05.09.2020. 

<!-- The basis of this declaration on accessibility is [a [BITV-]self-assessment [on the date | in the period from date to date] carried out by the TU Dresden | an evaluation (e.g. certification according to BITV 2.0) [on the date | in the period from date to date]] carried out by an independent body (name name!). -->

## State of accessibility
No BITV test for the web application Element has been performed yet.

## Non-accessible content 
* The login page has too low contrast.
* The chat application has too low contrast, can only be operated in its basic features using a screen reader.
* The chat application is not always operable with the keyboard.
